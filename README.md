To Run this application first you have to install NodeJs, just follow the instructions on [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After the NodeJs installation go to the root folder of this project, ./nodejs and run the following

* npm install

This will install all dependencies on your local machine and to run the server run the following command

* DEBUG=myapp:* npm start

To test the API you can use Postman Rest Client,

[Postman Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm)

Using the following API and sending a Json with the list of books.

This will sort the books using the parameters provide on the url

* http://127.0.0.1:3000/books/sort

Method

* Post

Header

* Content-Type : application/json\n

Parameters

* title = asc OR desc
* author = asc OR desc
*  year = asc OR desc

Example

* http://127.0.0.1:3000/books/sort?year=asc&author=desc

You just have to pass the parameters that you want to sort and in the order that you want, ?year=asc&title=desc will
produce a different output as ?title=desc&year=asc

If none or a wrong parameter is passed the service will not sort the wrong parameter or not sort at all.

Those are shortcuts to sortByTitle and sortByAuthor

http://127.0.0.1:3000/books/sortByTitle

http://127.0.0.1:3000/books/sortByAuthor


The Json must have this format to work

```
{
"books": [
    {
        "title": "title",   
        "author": "author",
        "year": "year"
    }    
]
}
```
The following is the Json provide on the assessment

```
{
"books": [
    {
        "title": "Java How To Program",        
        "author": "Deitel & Deitel",        
        "year": "2007"        
    },    
    {    
        "title": "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture",
        "author": "Martin Fowler",        
        "year": "2002"       
    },    
    {    
        "title": "Head First Design Patterns",   
        "author": "Elisabeth Freeman",        
        "year": "2004"
    },
    {
        "title": "Internet & World Wide Web: How to Program",   
        "author": "Deitel & Deitel",
        "year": "2007"
    }
]
}
```
